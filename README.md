If you are going to use Stripe, you should have already set up your account and project.
And as we are in development mode you have to raise your local webhook, running this command:

```bash
  stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhook
```

> It should be noted that you must have **stripe** installed to run that command!

**If you do not do this step, when you want to make the purchase you will get an error.**
